# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset
# Summary:

In this EDA project, we attempt to get insights from The Global Terrorism Database. The database has information about more than 180,000 terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The database has detailed information about the attack such as attacker, target, latitude and longitude of attack and so on. We initially try to create a Dataframe with just the data which we will need for analysis, we check the data for missing variables and proceed to find insights. We will use numpy for mathematical calculations, Pandas for Dataframe manipulation and Seaborn and matplotlib for visualization. We try to arrive at conclusions to reduce the number and impact of terrorist attacks by analysing the attacks in this Database

# Steps 

Data cleaning:
Data cleaning involves removing columns of the dataset which are not relevant for our analysis. Analysing the types of data in our dataset, finding out missing 
or duplcate values and dealing with these values.

Exploratory Data Analysis :- 
We explore data using data wrangling techniques and come up with sets of data from which we can derive meaningful insights.
Data Visualization: 
This step involves the creation of bar charts, pie charts, line plots and other visualizations to arrive at insights and to represent data easily.

# Conclusion

1.Iraq is the most attacked country with 24636 attacks

2.Baghdad, the capital of Iraq is the most attacked city, with 7589 attacks.

3.Phillipines is the country with the most number of ransom attacks which succeeded.

4.$275000000 was the highest ransom paid in a ransom attack. Al-Basiyah

5.India is the country with the most kidnapping operations. 7515 people kidnapped.

6.Taliban is the terrorist group with Most number of Attacks.

7.Bombs and Explosives are the most used method of attack for terrorists

8.Unclaimed attacks result in more casualties compared to claimed attacks

9.95.9 percent of Student Radicals are from the US and 73 percent of the attacks happened in 1970

10.Drastic increase in number of attacks is noted since 2012.

11.2014 had the highest number of attacks.

12.Taliban, ISIL, Shining Path and FMLN are the top 4 terrorist groups.

13.2014 recorded the highest number of casualties(85618)

14.Al-Qaida has a casualty ratio of 383, which means 383 kills per attack.Next on the list is LTTE with 13 kills per attack.

15.27.8% of all attacks have happened in Middle East and North Africa

16.Private Citizens and property have been the most affected, followed by Military and Police as the second and third most affected respectively. 23.9% of all attacks have been on Private Citizens and Property.

17.Number of attacks in educational institutions have been increasing since 2006.2012 was the year with most number of terrorist incidents in educational institutions. (276)

18.Central America and Carribbean region have a very low number of failed attacks to successful attacks. We can observe that around 96 percent of attacks in Central America and Carribbean region turn out successful. In regions with more than 10000 attacks, Western Europe appears to have more number of failed attacks compared to successful attacks

19.North America has the lowest percentage of successful terror attacks.(83.7%)

20.50.9% of all terrorist attacks are done using explosives. 32.2% attacks are done using firearms

21.We observe that all 4 of the top terror organizations use firearms and explosives the most, restricting access to these weapons could be the first step in slowing down their attacks.

22.Identifying most attacked Cities and Countries could aid in reducing damages done,by increasing precautionary measures such as high security, weapon control, in these areas.

23.Restricting raw material for the production of explosives and strict gun Laws could bring down a large number of attacks since bombing is the most used attack type.

24.Western Europe has the lowest percentage of success of terror attacks(among areas with more than 10000 attacks)(85.1%) In other words, terror attacks fail the most in Western Europe. Analyzing Western Europe's countermeasures to terror attacks could be the answer to bringing down successful attack percentage in heavily attacked regions.

25.A dip in terror attacks is seen in 1998. Analysing what caused the dip in terror attacks in 1998 could help in recreating the scenario again, thereby bringing down number of attacks.

25.Availability of efficient emergency medical services in highly attacked areas could help in bringing down the death toll due to terrorist attacks.
